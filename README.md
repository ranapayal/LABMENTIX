>Mini Compiler + Garbage Collector Simulator-
A simple web-based mini compiler and garbage collector simulator built with Flask.
This app lets you enter multiple code expressions, tokenize them, build a parse tree, evaluate expressions, and simulate garbage collection with reference counting.

>Features-
Input multiple expressions separated by semicolons (;).
Tokenizes numbers, identifiers, operators, and assignments.
Builds and displays a basic parse tree for assignment statements.
Evaluates arithmetic expressions involving variables and numbers.
Maintains a symbol table showing variable values and reference counts.
Simulates garbage collection by removing variables with zero references.
Displays garbage collection logs for transparency.

>Getting Started-
>Prerequisites-
Python 3.x
Flask (pip install flask)
>Running the Application-
Save the code into a file named app.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing app.py.

Run the Flask app:
